# Magnetic Anisotropy

This work contains the script used to process data about domain magnetisations obtained using the Kerr microscope.

The script normalizes the data containing hysteresis curves and then subsequently fits suitable linear regressions to obtain various intercepts.

Finally, the script generates figures from all of these steps to be used in the final report.
